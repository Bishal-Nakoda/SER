## About The Project

[![Proposed System ScreenShot][https://github.com/Bishal-Nakoda/SER/blob/4ea09c2f5b9e8f8e4233a6319b284a20bbc9971b/demo.png]](https://github.com/Bishal-Nakoda/SER)

Emotions plays a vital role in a human’s life as it is a medium of expression of one’s perspective to others. With the Help of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), we can recognize the emotions a person is experiencing just from his/her speech. Essentially, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can help us further develop man-machine interface.

Here's how:
* A feature selection technique is assessed to obtain good features from the set of features extracted
* The expected output is the type of emotion which will be derived from the raw speech signal given as input by the user
* A spectrogram(a visual way of representing the signal strength) is also provided along with the output
